      About Me
    </h1>
    <article>
      <p class="box round">
      My main passion has been creating things. Stories, inventions, and now code. So why not show off the things I made previously while showing off my new website building skills? At the top of the page you can find links to other pages I've made which showcase various creations of mine such as animations, drawings and short stories. For now, I will put thing solely related to programming here on the main page. I'm excited to be learning to code because it's a huge opportunity to improve my way of life. Of course this wouldn't be possible without a good team to be a member of. I still have a lot to learn and my experiences so far in life have shown clearly that finding your role ins a group of like-minded individuals to succeed. My brother is a graphic designer and has work with programmers closly for years as he learned some coding himself.
